House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he made lots of friends and lived
happily ever after...  He definitely didn't get axe murdered.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to
begin, and let me assure you he will ___DEFINITELY NOT DIE!___

While Joffrey may not have died he certainly didn't live a decent life whatsoever. It was full of gout and other unfortunate ailments. Heart burn, back pain, and sleep issues plagued him on a daily basis.
